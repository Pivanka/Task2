In this and that book, you can contemplate the terrible model of the Soviet Union or other totalitarian states. However, in the novel \"1984\" it is depicted much more deeply. Therefore, sometimes when you read, you cannot believe that humanity has really lost such a model of behavior and only a few are able to fight against it. However, will this lead to victory and the overthrow of the system? After reading this work, I can only say that it is always worth fighting against what does not reach you. Do not be silent. After all, there can be thousands or millions of people like you, and together you can achieve much more than you can alone. Definitely recommend reading!", Reviewer="Ksyusha"},
